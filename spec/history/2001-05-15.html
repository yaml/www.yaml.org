Key Concepts

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#fffff7">

<P>
YAML is founded on several key concepts from very
successful languages. </P>

<UL>

<LI>YAML uses similar type structure as Perl. In YAML,
there there are three fundamental structures: scalars ($),
maps (%), and lists (@).  YAML also supports references to
enable the serilization of graphs.  Furthermore,
each data value can be associated with a class name
to allow the use of specific data types.

<LI>YAML uses block scoping similar to Python.  In YAML,
the extent of a node is indicated by its child's
nesting level, i.e., what column it is in.   Block
indenting provides for easy inspection of the document's
structure which helps to identify scope errors.

<LI>YAML uses similar whitespace handling as HTML. In
YAML, sequences of spaces, tabs, and carriage return
characters are folded into a single space during parse.
This wonderful technique makes markup code readable by
enabling indentation and word-wrapping without affecting
the canonical form of the content.

<LI>YAML uses similar slash style escape sequences as C.
In YAML, \n is used to represent a new line, \t is used to
represent a tab, and \\ is used to represent the slash.
In addition, since whitespace is folded, YAML uses bash
style "\ " to escape additional spaces that are part of
the content and should not be folded.  Lastly, the trailing
\ is used as a continuation marker, allowing
content to be broken into multiple lines without
introducing unwanted whitespace.

<LI>YAML allows for a
  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt">rfc822</a>
compatible header area for comments, specific processing
instructions, and encoding declarations.  This provides
a flexible and forward looking method to augment the
YAML parser with other features such as a validator
similar to TREX or RELAX.  Furthermore, this will allow
a mail processing system to directly use YAML as its
input parser.

<LI>YAML supports binary and formatted text entities with
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt">MIME</a>
multi-part attachments.  Each attachment is given an
reference identifier which can be associated with a
location in hierarchical YAML content.  This allows
leaf values which would distrupt the in-line structural
flow to be handled out of band in a seperate block mechanism.

<LI>YAML has a <a href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/">SAX</a>
like sequential "C" <a href="yaml.h">API</a>.  This C library can be used to
easily construct native-language representations of a YAML
serilization.  The API also show cases a clever
substitutability technique which allows schema changes
to occur at the leaf nodes in a backwards compatible
manner without breaking older code.  This brings resiliance
to older code, while allowing the structure of your data
to grow over time.

Below is an example of an invoice expressed via YAML.
Each value's type indicated by either percent (map), or
an at (list) sign, or an optional dollar sign (scalar).
The content for each value follows the indicator either
on the same line for scalars or on subsequent indented
lines. The content for a map, which is also the starting
production, is a list of key value paris. Each key and
value are seperated by a colon.</P>

<P>Since "product" is a list, it only has values and thus
is missing the key and colon.  Also notice that the
"comments" scalar is on multiple lines. Since whitespace
is folded, the carriage return (\n) is escaped and
the line ending \ is required to keep housekeeper as
a single word.  By default, the serilizer will
sort map keys, although this isn't a requirement
of the serilization structure.

Example: References and Class Names

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#fffff7">

<P>
Below is an example of a YAML document which demonstrates
the use of references and classes.  Immediately after an
indicator a class name can occur and then within parenthesis
an optional reference handle.  If the indicator is a "*",
then no further content is allowed, as this indicator
signifies a reference to another value.  The class name may
be used as a specific language specific binding to
a particular object or type appropriate class, otherwise
it can be considered a comment.  The production for allowable
names and a namespace mechanism have yet to be worked out.

    This is a synthesized attribute of every Value.  If
    the Value is a Scalar, then the Default property
    refers to the Value itself.  If this Value is a List,
    then the Default refers to the Default property of the
    first Value in its sequence.  If the Value is a Map,
    then Default refers to the Default property of the
    Value in its Pair entry lacking a Key.  By using
    Default, a Scalar Value can be substituted with
    a Map or a List Value without braking older code.

<P>
Take careful note that the information model does not
admit a "parent" property of each value.  Quite the
contrary, YAML may be a graph structure and is not
necessarly a tree.

For Python, the internal representation has a top-level
object is a Dictionary, and from there, depending upon
each value's indicator, can either be a List, Dictionary
or a String.  It is possible for a schema mechansim to
be included which affords for more specific decoding
into classes and types.  The default attribute is
implemented through a stand-alone function.
<P>
For Perl, the internal represenation starts with a
top-level hash.  And from there, depending upon the
indicators can either be a list, hash, or string scalar.
Of course, it is also possible for a schema mechanism
to be included which affords for more specific decoding.
The default attribute is implemeted through a stand-alone
function.
<P>
Haven't done Java or Javascript since '98, but I remember
Strings, Maps and Lists being Objects.  So there shouldn't be
any problem in Java.  Javascript is probably in the
same boat but I can't veryify since that book has
mysteriously dissapeared as well.
<P>
For ML, C, and C++ all of which lack a built-in, variable
type Map and List structure require a specific schema
to build an internal representation.  For these languages,
a YamlValue type could be created with sub-types of
Scalar, List, and Map.  For C++, STL could make the
implementation very quick, especially with iterator
support.  An alternative approach would be a class
builder... but this, of course, requires a bit
more smarts and a schema system.
<P>
Mapping to a relational database will also require
some sort of schema to indicate how to pack/unpack.
However, given that a tuple (record) is easlily
associated with a Map, and a relation (table) is
easily associated with a List, there should not be
that much difficulty.  Mapping NULL values will
be represented by a lack of a particular map
entry.

      Any takers?
  <LI>Was thinking hard about using # for a comment

      Benfits?  In any case, the BNF should leave
