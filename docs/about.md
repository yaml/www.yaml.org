# About YAML

## What is YAML?

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization
language designed for data exchange between languages with different data
structures.

It's often used for configuration files, data exchange, and representing
complex data structures in a readable format.

## Key Features

- **Human Readable** - Easy to read and write for both humans and machines
- **Language Independent** - Works across programming languages and platforms
- **Hierarchical** - Supports complex nested data structures
- **Extensible** - Can be extended with custom data types
- **Secure** - Built with security considerations in mind

## History

YAML was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001, and was designed together
with Ingy döt Net and Oren Ben-Kiki.

The name "YAML" is a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language",
emphasizing that YAML is primarily a data serialization language rather than
a markup language.

## Why YAML Matters Today

### Infrastructure as Code
YAML is the de facto standard for defining infrastructure configurations
in tools like Kubernetes, Docker Compose, and Terraform.

### DevOps and CI/CD
Modern CI/CD pipelines rely heavily on YAML for defining build steps,
deployment configurations, and automation workflows.

### Cloud-Native Applications
As organizations move to cloud-native architectures, YAML becomes
increasingly critical for managing complex distributed systems.

### Configuration Management
YAML provides a clean, readable way to manage application configurations
across different environments and deployment stages.
